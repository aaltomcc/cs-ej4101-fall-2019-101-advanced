      <description>In the beginning, the buzzword “DevOps” did not mean so much to me and I had no idea what to expect from this course apart from deciphering the word itself. I merely know that it was something everyone seemed to worship about. However, after learning more about it, I understand why there are so many advocates for it.
I think DevOps is a very good way to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment to streamline the development process.</description>

      <description>This course cs-ej4101-fall-2019-XXX-advanced caught my yee because:
 I knew every little about it and it seemed to be a very hot topic in the field I believed this course might help me improve my development practices  From my very limited experience with web development, I have notice how unorganised/poorly-managed development process can diminish the development outcome. For example, when testing was not done in a continuous manner, I might end up finding some silly bugs after I code up all the files.</description>
