        <p>In the beginning, the buzzword “DevOps” did not mean so much to me and I had no idea what to expect from this course apart from deciphering the word itself. I merely know that it was something everyone seemed to worship about. However, after learning more about it, I understand why there are so many advocates for it.</p>
<p>I think DevOps is a very good way to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment to streamline the development process. I think the biggest benefit is to allow developers to receive immediate feedback of their code based on the testing and integration results. The sooner the developer gets the feedback, the easier it is for him/her to go back to the problematic part of the code, therefore the less time is needed to fix it.</p>
<p>This course has also opened my eyes to one of the continuous development tool - Travis. The tool gave me valuable first-hand experience in how we can make use this kind of tool to streamline the testing and deployment process. I will definitely try to implement this tool in my future projects.</p>
<p>I have also learnt about Hugo - a static website generation tool. Since I am quite used to build website the traditional way - with basic HTML and CSS or content management system - I feel that I am not a very big fan of solutions like Hugo. Since it involves using the command line quite a lot, so I am not sure whether I would recommend it to my friend who are starting out in web development. Nonetheless, I think it is a great tool for those who just want to be able to create and publish website quickly, and for those who are not very particular about the design of the website.</p>
<p>By the way, please meet my learning assistant.
