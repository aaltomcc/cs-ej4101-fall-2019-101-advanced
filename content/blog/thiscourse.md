This course **cs-ej4101-fall-2019-XXX-advanced** caught my yee because:

- I knew every little about it and it seemed to be a very hot topic in the field
- I believed this course might help me improve my development practices

From my very limited experience with web development, I have notice how unorganised/poorly-managed development process can diminish the development outcome. For example, when testing was not done in a continuous manner, I might end up finding some silly bugs after I code up all the files. I might have to go through all the files, spot the problematic part, and fix them. In fact, before I could even do that, I might have to spend hours and hours to figure out where the problem is.

Since I am a self-taught programmer, my learning has always been extremely coding-focused. At some point, I started to realise that there might be some knowledge gaps which was hindering my learning progress, and which was not coding-related but process-related. That is when I started looking into best practices in managing development projects and it did not take long for me to come across something about DevOps.

I tried to learn more about it, but I found it a little hard to find practical resources and solid detailed examples about it. There seems to be many different way to practise DevOps which also makes it hard to judge whoâ€™s explaining it best. Therefore, when I saw this course on the list on FiTech, it immediately caught my eye. I have really enjoyed learning in this course.
