Moi, my name is **Sanna**. This is a very Finnish or Swedish name, or so I’m told, but I am neither Finnish nor Swedish. I’m from Hong Kong and I moved to Finland less than a year ago.

I graduated a few years ago with a BA in English Studies. My first exposure the tech/software was in a general education course in my uni years, where I discovered my interests in the field. Based on my positive learning outcome, my then professor encouraged me to purpue deeper knowledge in programming, when chances arise.

Around 1.5 years ago, I left my two jobs and finally had the chance to try something new. Therefore, I decided to try my hands in programming, which I immediately fell in love with. In the beginning, my learning had a strong focus on app development but later my interests in web development grew and left me with much less time with app. I feel that web is much more easy-going and beginner-friendly than app.

Currently, I am trying to learn more via courses on [FiTech](https://fitech.io/en/). :)

Here are two blog posts about one of the courses that I'm currently working on:

- [This course cs-ej4101-fall-2019-XXX-advanced](blog/thiscourse)
- [Learning](blog/learning)

Tech stuff aside, I like reading fiction, knitting, crocheting, running and binging on cat videos. Oh, I would like to intro to you my cat friend, his name is Riesa, which - as I'm told - means "pain in the ass" in Finnish. He got this name because he likes to poop _next to_ the litter box rather than _in_ it. :D
