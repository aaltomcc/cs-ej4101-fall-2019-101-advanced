Moi, my name is Sanna. This is a very Finnish or Swedish name, or so I’m told, but I am not Finnish or Swedish. I’m from Hong Kong and I moved to Finland less than a year ago.

I graduated a few years ago with a BA in English Studies. My first exposure with the tech/software field was in a general education course in my uni years, where I unexpectedly became the top student in the class. My professor told me that I was in the wrong major, which has stuck in my head since then.

Around 1.5 years ago, I left my two jobs and finally had the chance to try something new, so I decided to try my hands in programming, which I immediately fell in love with. In the beginning, my learning had a strong focus on app development but later my interests in web development grew and left me with much less time with app. I feel that web is much more easy-going and beginner-friendly than app.

Currently, I am trying to learn more via courses on FiTech. :)

Tech stuff aside, I like reading fiction, knitting, crocheting, running and binging on cat videos. Oh I also want to intro my cat friend to you, his name is Riesa. :D
